== Accumulator Demo ==

This demo shows how you can use CRAFT to configure the precision of a small
example accumulator. The accumulator stores the sum of some irrelevant
calculations, but is initialized to 1.0 so that if singles are used, the
additions don't actually get saved since there isn't enough precision to do them
properly.

STEP 1: Look at the source code and verify understanding.

STEP 2: Compile and test demo program:
    make && ./demo

STEP 3: Verify success of sanity check
    fpinst --svinp double demo

STEP 4: Verify failure of whole-program replacement:
    fpinst --svinp single demo

STEP 5: Build "a priori" optimal configuration:
    fpconfed demo    # when GUI loads, toggle the last addition in main()
                     # to DOUBLE (red) and click "Save"

STEP 6: Test "a priori" optimal configuration:
    fpinst -c demo.cfg demo

STEP 7: Look at craft_driver and verify understanding.

STEP 8: Run autoconfiguration script:
    mkdir auto && cd auto
    craft search ../demo

STEP 9: Verify that automatically-generated config matches the "a priori" one:
    fpconfed craft_final.cfg
